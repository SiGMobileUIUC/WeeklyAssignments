-:tv: For this assignment you will want to use a ListView builder to easily create 12 listTiles that you will display with values connected to each.

-:cd: Inside the builder you will want to have a leading widget of a CircleAvatar that has a random color for each ListTile.

-:book: Inside the builder you will also want to have a title that says "I am a ListTile", as well as a subtitle that shows the index in the format    

"Index: 2".

-:keyboard: Before we get to the last part of the builder, we will want to create a list<int> of indeces outside the build widget so that we can keep track of each listTile.

-:mag: After the other parameters of the listTile you will want a way to remove each listTile and for that we will use an IconButton that calls a external function that uses setState to update list of indices by removing the specific index and updating the screen.
